# PyLungScan
This project uses a neural network created with Tensorflow to analyze lung CT 
scan images in DICOM format and predict whether the images contain a cancerous tumour.
We hope to achieve the following goals:
 * Read in CT image datasets from DICOM files into Python
 * Create and train a neural network based on a lung cancer diagnosed dataset
 * Differentiate healthy lung images from cancerous ones
 * Achieve at least a 60 percent accuracy in diagnosis
 * Keep false positive occurances below 30 percent
